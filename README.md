# TypeScript Type Mismatch Bug
This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error related to type mismatches. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but the code attempts to pass a string as the second argument, resulting in a type error.

The solution provides a type guard to handle the potential type mismatch more gracefully.
